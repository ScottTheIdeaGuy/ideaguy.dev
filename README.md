# What the heck is this?

My name's Scotty Rich. I have some tools I made for myself that I wanna be able to access on the go for MAXIMUM PRODUCTIVITY. 

GitHub has free hosting options, and I still have the ideaguy.dev domain. So I'm dumping it here. Now everybody's gonna see all the horribly formatted code I wrote on my phone while waiting at the checkout line at Walgreens! ¡Que vergonzoso!

I guess you can use the code here if you want? I'd probably keep it private if I had the option, but that's paywalled. Not that it really makes a difference? You can look at the code of any webpage by hitting F12. But what do I know? I'm sure GitHub makes bank on enterprise.

Sincerely,


Scooty
